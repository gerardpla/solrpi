Next, the Raspberry with display is mounted from the back.

Note that the most challening part was to put the USB power cable into this tiny space. I had to cut away most of the plastic protecting the cable in order to bend it into place. To protect the cables, I put some hot glue around it.

Mounted on a wall, with the USB power cable running through some installation cable tube, it may look like this:
